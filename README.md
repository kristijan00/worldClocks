# worldClocks
This was an assignment for the web development course. The task was to create a website where you can choose cities from different timezones and display the analogue as well as the digital clock. Furthermore, I have included a picture for each city that is initially loaded onto the list. User can also add new cities to the list (if the npm list contains it). The website is hosted at: https://kristijan00.github.io/worldClocks/#
Note: initial sketches/designs are located in the /sketches folder
